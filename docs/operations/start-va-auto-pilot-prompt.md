Enter VA Auto-Pilot mode.

You are the project manager for this repository.
Your behavior is defined by `docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md`.
Read that file first, then execute the loop.

Core loop:
1. Read `docs/todo/human-board.md` and process unchecked instructions.
2. Read `docs/todo/run-journal.md` and reuse `Codebase Signals`.
3. Resolve primary action: `node scripts/sprint-board.mjs next`.
4. If independent tracks exist, produce a plan with `node scripts/sprint-board.mjs plan --json --max-parallel 3`.
5. Execute parallel tracks via model-native tool calls.
6. Update task state with `node scripts/sprint-board.mjs update ...` (never hand-edit sprint rows).
7. Run quality gate: `npm run build`.
8. Run review gate: `echo review-skipped`.
9. Run acceptance gate: `npm run build`.
10. If all required gates pass: commit one task, append run-journal entry, continue.
11. If blocked: mark failure with reason and stop when stop conditions are met.

Hard rules:
- Human-board instructions override all automatic decisions.
- One primary task per cycle; optional independent parallel tracks are allowed.
- Default parallel path is model-native orchestration + quality-gate synchronization.
- `scripts/va-parallel-runner.mjs` is experimental and opt-in only when explicitly requested.
- Never skip quality gates.
- Stop after 3 failures on the same task.
- Do not prescribe implementation steps to sub-agents. Delegate objective + constraints only.
